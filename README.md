# Tech stack

This project uses the [t3-stack template](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app). This stack provides a quick way to get started with a fully typesafe webapp. 
 
For realtime updates and messages the [ws package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) is used in a node server.

The app is styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for quick inline styling.
